Implementing a C# web server using .net Kestrel library

I wanted a plain vanilla https web server that is based on 
current Microsoft Kestrel libraries.

The web server is running in the command window under Win 10
and uses Serilog to display the activity.

Apart from the .NETCore library version 3.1.0, 
AspNetCore library is needed as well as the various 
serilog libraries. Serilog finally uses 
Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration

I have worked in VS Community 2019
